    <p>A web page is a digital document accessible on the World Wide Web. It consists of content, often written in HTML,
         and can include text, images, multimedia, links, and interactive elements. Web pages are hosted on web servers 
         and are displayed in web browsers, allowing users to access and interact with information, services, or products
          online. They are a fundamental building block of the internet and can serve various purposes, from providing 
          information and entertainment to facilitating e-commerce, social networking, and communication. Web pages can 
          be static or dynamic, and their design and functionality can vary widely depending on the goals and technologies
           used by web developers and designers.
