            Use to indicate emphasis on text.
            Typically displayed as italicized text.

            Use to underline text.
            Best practice is to avoid using it solely for decorative purposes, and instead use it for hyperlinks or specific cases where underlining is semantically meaningful.
            <s> (Strikethrough)
            
            Use to denote text that has been struck through.
            Best practice is to use it to indicate content that has been removed or is no longer relevant.

            Use to render text as subscript.

            Use to highlight or mark specific portions of text.
